It’s important to note that sterling silver is not pure silver. <\/p><p>In the case of common sterling silver, the alloy is 92.5% pure silver and 7.5% copper, nickel, or brass. At Boho-Magic, though, most of our alloys are nickel-free and consist mostly of copper and zinc. This specific composition is fundamental in producing sterling silver rings and it's the reason behind the presence of the Sterling Silver 925 hallmarks.<\/p><p>At Boho-Magic, our rings bear the mark \"925\" as a badge of honor, signifying a blend of 92.5% pure silver and 7.5% other metals, most commonly copper and zinc. This marriage of metals bestows upon sterling silver its strength, resilience, and radiance that catches the eye from across a crowded room.<br\/><br\/>To learn even more about .925 sterling silver, check out our article about this <a href=\"https:\/\/boho-magic.com\/en-ca\/blogs\/the-journal\/what-does-sterling-silver-925-mean-in-a-ring\" title=\"everything you need to know about sterling silver jewelry and care at boho magic\">here<\/a>.<\/p>"}},"569d5ba9-46b7-4e56-abde-1c0d6dec4fee":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Will .925 sterling silver turn my skin green?","text":"<p>.925 sterling silver does not turn skin green. For some designs, though, we use an oxidizing powder to give the ring a more vintage look! If there is an excess of powder left on the ring then this can cause temporary skin discoloration which can be remedied right away so it doesn't happen again!<\/p><p>If this occurs, we recommend lightly washing your ring. Do this by mixing warm water with a mild, fragrance-free soap, giving the ring a bit of a soak and using a soft cloth to gently clean out crevices. Avoid using brushes as they might cause scratching. Once clean, make sure to quickly rinse and dry it well.<br\/><br\/>For more information on this topic, check out our blog post titled, <a href=\"https:\/\/boho-magic.com\/blogs\/the-journal\/does-sterling-silver-turn-your-finger-green\" title=\"Answering the question: will sterling silver turn my skin green?\">‘Does Sterling Silver Turn Your Skin Green?”<\/a><\/p>"}},"99bd1789-9614-445c-9440-de5aad01a215":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"My ring oxidized and changed color.
